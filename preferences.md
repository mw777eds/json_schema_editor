# Preferences for Code Comments and Structure

1. All comments should use the `/* */` format, not the `//` format.
2. Each section of code should have a description comment explaining the functionality in human-readable text.
3. Do not remove comments for no reason.
4. Adjust comments to be correct if the functionality changes.
5. Do not add comments at the line level; only at the code block level.
